            This dissertation examines the extent to which children’s tablet
            software applications, commonly called apps, are designed
            appropriately to promote the optimal development of preschool
            children aged three to five. This study extends previous research,
            particularly the theoretical frameworks of developmentally
            appropriate practice and Bers’ positive technological development.
            The researcher argues that, for children’s mobile apps to be
            developmentally meaningful, they need to satisfy three conditions:
            (1) apps must be designed appropriately to accommodate the
            developmental stages and needs of young children; (2) content must
            be designed to promote young children’s development in the areas of
            cognition, academic skills, social-emotional skills, and physical
            development; and (3) digital interactions engage children in
            activities and behaviors that foster optimal developmental assets.
            This study examined 100 children’s apps from the Apple’s App Store
            in regard to design, content, and features. The findings underscore
            the need for developmentally meaningful children’s mobile apps for
            preschool children.

            This thesis describes a cross-sectional study that looked at the
            level of online civic engagement among college students and its
            association with their technological experience and characteristics.
            In particular, this study applied the positive youth development
            framework to examine a) how college students differ in their uses of
            the Internet for pro-social purposes, and b) how these differences
            might be associated with variations in their technological
            experiences and their attitudes about technology. Results showed
            that online civic engagement among the eight-five college students
            in the study could be described in terms of three underlying
            constructs interpreted as perceived technological efficacy, social
            uses of technology, and technological contribution. Variations in
            these characteristics were associated with the extent to which
            participants demonstrated uses of online technologies for civic and
            pro-social purposes.
